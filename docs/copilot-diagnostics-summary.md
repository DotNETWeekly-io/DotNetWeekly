## English Translation

Microsoft has launched the "Copilot Diagnostics" toolset in Visual Studio, introducing deep AI support for .NET debugging and performance analysis. The goal is to reduce developers' repetitive work in breakpoints, exception handling, and performance troubleshooting, accelerating problem identification and resolution.

### Main Capabilities Overview

• **Breakpoint and Tracepoint Suggestions**: Copilot analyzes current code and context to automatically generate precise conditional expressions or Tracepoint actions, without manual configuration.

• **Breakpoint Failure Diagnosis**: When breakpoints fail to hit, you can directly ask Copilot, which will check symbols, build configuration, optimization levels, and other common causes, providing fix steps.

• **IEnumerable Visualization + LINQ Assistance**: Collection data is displayed in table format. Users can use natural language to have Copilot generate or rewrite LINQ queries, quickly filtering out anomalous data.

• **LINQ Hover Explanation**: During debugging, hovering over LINQ statements, Copilot will explain their meaning, evaluate execution results, and point out potential performance issues.

• **Exception Assistant**: When exceptions are caught, Copilot summarizes errors, infers root causes, and provides targeted code modification suggestions, rather than just displaying stack traces.

• **Variable and Return Value Analysis**: When hovering over variables or viewing method return values, you can call Copilot to get possible causes of value anomalies and contextual explanations.

• **Parallel Stack Analysis**: In the Parallel Stacks window, Copilot generates summaries for each thread and automatically detects clues of deadlocks, hangs, or crashes.

### Performance Analysis Capabilities

• **CPU Usage, Instrumentation, .NET Allocation** tools all add Auto Insights, summarizing hot paths, high-cost functions, and zero-length array issues.

• **"Ask Copilot" Button** supports further queries, such as loop optimization, memory allocation reduction, and other practical guidance.

• Microsoft is planning to launch a more **"agent-like" experience**, making it easy for non-performance experts to complete diagnosis and optimization.

### Overall Value

Copilot Diagnostics doesn't replace developer skills, but embeds in the IDE, fits the context, automatically provides information and fix ideas, helping engineers focus their time on real business logic and feature delivery. The blog currently includes two demonstration videos showing actual usage in debugging and Profiler scenarios.
